#### **Course Description and Outcomes**

Students will learn how to integrate 
programming into operating system management. They will learn how to 
automate systems administration functions and connectivity testing. 
Powershell and Linux shell scripting will be explored to manage and 
monitor operating system processes and functions. Students will create 
programs that can be reused in production networks.

#### **Learning Objectives**

- Create reusable programs for managing Windows and Linux operating Systems
- Plan the development of programs to minimize system resource utilization
- Develop cross-platform programs that interact with shell scripts and Powershell scripts
- Implement Powershell on Linux and shell scripting on Windows
- Interpret the output of data collected from scripts
- Select the most efficient native commands functions to complete administrative tasks

#### **Prerequisites**

Complete SYS-255

#### **Text Books**

There is no mandatory book for this course. However, the following books are very helpful for beginners:

- Mastering Linux shell scripting : a practical guide to Linux 
  command- line, Bash scripting, and Shell programming / Mokhtar Ebrahim, 
  Andrew Mallett.
- Cybersecurity Ops with bash : attack, defend, and analyze from the command line / Paul Troncone and Carl Albing.

Both are accessible/available through:

#### **Grading**

| Graded Elements | Percentage |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Lab/Class-Work  | 40%        |
| Assignments     | 20%        |
| Midterm         | 15%        |
| Final           | 20%        |
| Participation   | 5%         |
| **Total**       | 100%       |

#### **Teaching Methods**

This is an introductory course to Powershell and Bash and you are 
learning new material and developing new “schemas” or building on 
existing ones.

Classes will have short lectures, followed by class activities for hands on learning.

#### **Submissions**

Assignments must be submitted to GitHub. In your assignment on 
Canvas, you post the link to the repo for the week. We are going to 
setup a connection for this in the first week.

Assignments will be submitted with either screenshots or recorded videos of your scripts executing.

#### **Late Submission Policy**

Any late work should be discussed with the instructor. Otherwise, 10% of the grade will be deducted each late day.

I understand that completing an assignment late is better than not 
completing it at all. Therefore, you can discuss with the instructor 
your excuse to not get any points deducted for your work. However, we 
need to set some rules:

- You have to inform the instructor about your excuse for late 
  submission. Late submissions with no excuses will not be receiving full 
  points.
- It is difficult for the instructor to follow up late submissions 
  individually for every single assignment. Therefore, late submissions 
  have no guarantees on timely grading. You can expect late submissions to
   be graded late.

#### **Attendance Policy**

Unexcused absence from one week of class will have an impact on your 
final grade. Unexcused absence of two weeks of class will result in a 
letter grade drop on your final grade. Unexcused absence of more than 
two weeks of classes will result in an automatic 'F'. Specifically, this
 would mean missing more than two classes.

If illness, accident or similar circumstances make it impossible to 
attend a class, you are still responsible for covering the material and 
making up the work prior to the next class. Waiting until the next class
 to find out what was covered will not work. You are responsible for 
obtaining and completing the assignment. The information and content 
will be available on CANVAS and you can contact me with anything you 
need help with. Illnesses, accidents or similar circumstances could 
excuse you from being marked absent if you let me know ASAP. It is 
understandable that some illnesses or incidents may not allow immediate 
notification. If you are routinely ‘sick’ or other circumstances 
routinely occur I will submit a Student Referral Form to have Champlain 
staff investigate the issue.

#### **Academic Honesty Policy**

In addition to skills and knowledge, Champlain College aims to teach 
students appropriate Ethical and Professional Standards of Conduct.  The [Academic Honesty Policy](https://c3ee6f76138c450cf3db-e7a990372d0ff75c05c20fb5a79781b0.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/academic_honesty_2.html) exists
 to inform students and Faculty of their obligations in upholding the 
highest standards of professional and ethical integrity. Violations of 
the policy could result in a grade of F on the assignment or in the 
course as well as dismissal from the College.

All student work is subject to the Academic Honesty Policy. 
 Professional and Academic practice provides guidance about how to 
properly cite, reference, and attribute the intellectual property of 
others.  Any attempt to deceive a faculty member or to help another 
student to do so will be considered a violation of this standard.   

#### **Accessibility and Accommodations**

Students with a documented disability who require assistance or 
academic accommodations should contact the Office of Accessibility to 
discuss eligibility ([college policy](https://c3ee6f76138c450cf3db-e7a990372d0ff75c05c20fb5a79781b0.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/student_disabilities.html)).
 The Office of Accessibility staff are available to meet with students 
via Google Hangouts through the phone or video function. Meetings are by
 appointment only, so please contact the Office of Accessibility as soon
 as possible to discuss accommodations.  They can be reached by email 
(accessibility@champlain.edu) or phone - (802) 865-5764.  

#### **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**

As a learning community, we should be working together to create:

- An effective and respectful space.
- An environment that is safe and expecting, where everyone feels like they can bring their whole self to the table.
- A classroom that supports the ever changing and diverse learning needs and complexities of Champlain College students.
- A space that maximizes learning for everyone.

We all co-create this positive, inclusive learning environment. The 
following are guiding principles for his this can be created:

- Appreciate that everyone is in a different “space” of learning. We 
  all learn differently, we all have different skill levels, and we all 
  bring a unique personal context to the classroom. Each of us in this 
  class will know more in some areas and less in others.
- Share your knowledge and skills with tact. **Do not belittle your less-experienced classmates with snarky or condescending comments.** Instead, applaud each other’s efforts and offer constructive feedback when possible.
- Respect others’ perspectives and recognize your own biases and the limits of your own knowledge.
- Show respect for others as individuals by learning and using their preferred names and pronouns.
- Do not monopolize the conversation; rather, give others a chance to contribute.
- Take into consideration the impact of your words on others.
- **DO NOT make derogatory statements about a group of people 
  based on social, gender identity, racial, political, socio-economic 
  class or personal characteristics of that group.** Differences of opinion are encouraged and should be nurtured, "calling out" people is not the same thing. **Racial, ethnic, gender, or other identity-based slurs are nothing other than hurtful and will not be tolerated.**
